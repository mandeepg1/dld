In this project, I've created a 4 bit adder and attempted the 7-segement displays to go with it.
I made sure to create a full adder, 4 bit full adder, as well as a sub/adder. I use these in order to connect
to the binary to decimal or ("b2d") as I wanted the binary input to display a decimal output hence the
7 segement displays in our project example. I made sure everything was properly connected and did the best
I could at doing this project as it was very diffcult to try and achieve the perfect solution.
After many hours I still could not figure out this out correctly so hopefully my time put into this would
be acknowledged in order to recieve some partial credit. Thank you.
